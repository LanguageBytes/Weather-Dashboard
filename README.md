This is a simple Weather web application which uses a Third-Party-API, OpenWeather, to generate a personalised search result based on the user input.The application allows the user to type in a city name and be presented with a set of results. 

The results are split into two sections: the Current Weather and 5-Day Weather Forecast.

The current weather displays the chosen city, its current date, temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index. The user is able to visually see what the weather is like through an icon displayed next to the data. The user is able to determine whether the UV index is favourable, moderate or severe through a colour coded system. If the UV result is red, it is high, if it is orange, it is moderate, if it is green it is favourable.

The 5-Day Weather forecast displays the weather predictions for the next 5 days. They follow the same format as the current weather, minus the UV index.

The user is then able to return a previously searched city by accessing their search history, this is displayed on the bottom left part of the screen.
