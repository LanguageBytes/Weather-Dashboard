This is a simple Weather web application which uses a Third-Party-API, OpenWeather, to generate a personalised search result based on the user input.The application allows the user to type in a city name and be presented with a set of results. 

The results are split into two sections: the Current Weather and 5-Day Weather Forecast.

The current weather displays the chosen city, its current date, temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index. The user is able to visually see what the weather is like through an icon displayed next to the data. The user is able to determine whether the UV index is favourable, moderate or severe through a colour coded system. If the UV result is red, it is high, if it is orange, it is moderate, if it is green it is favourable.

The 5-Day Weather forecast displays the weather predictions for the next 5 days. They follow the same format as the current weather, minus the UV index.

The user is then able to return a previously searched city by accessing their search history, this is displayed on the bottom left part of the screen.

This project was a fun challenge! :) 

I found a lot of time was spent wiring up all of the different elements and making sure they worked together as a whole. I realised after calling and wiring up my first API, that it did not include a UV index, this meant I spent some time figuring out how I would express the Lat and Lon in the API call. This extra dimension to the task was very useful, as, through it, I now feel more confident in the process that is involved in calling APIs. 

This week in class our tutors have been very helpful in consolidating the concepts covered previously in class. We have reviewed Local Storage, and now feel a bit more confident in how the order of events should play out in the code. This is something that I was not as confident in before.

Aesthetically, I would like the page to look a bit more interesting and be more dynamic than it is currently. Also, I would have liked to have added an icon of some kind instead of just changing the text colour depending on the UV index. This is something I will keep working on in the future.
